#IPL 2023 Format: The format of the IPL 2023 edition will be the same as the previous year but there will be changes in the venues. Following are the details of the IPL 2023 Format:

#The ten teams are divided into two groups of five.

#A random draw was used to determine the groups and who plays whom across the groups once and twice.



#In the group stage, each team plays 14 games facing the other four teams in their group two times each (one home and one away game), four teams in the other group once, and the remaining team two times.

#IPL Points Table system: The team winning a match will be awarded 2 points. The losing team will not receive any points. In case of a draw or no result, both teams will be awarded 1 point.

#A four-game playoff stage following the Page playoff system is held after the group stage.

# Four games will be played in the playoffs:

#Qualifier 1: between the teams ranked first and second in the group stage.




#Eliminator: between the teams ranked third and fourth in the group stage.


#Qualifier 2: between the loser of Qualifier 1 and the winner of the Eliminator.
